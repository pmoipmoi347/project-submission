# project-submission
This repository is for submiting project codes of CSE574-Spring 2020. Please follow the submission instructions below to submit your project codes.

- Step 1: Search `CSE574Spring2020/project-submission`, then click 'Fork' on the topright corner.
- Step 2 (optional): New pull request (Base fork:Your/Base: **master** <— Head Fork: CSE574Spring2020's/Compare: **master**). Note that you may need to *1) switch the base for your comparison*, *2) compare across forks*, *3) creat pull request*, *4) merge pull request*, *5) confirm merge*. This step is important which merges this repository to your own's. However, it means that there is nothing changed in th master branch when showing nothing to compare. Then you can skip step 2.
- Step 3: Upload your codes to your own repository.
- Step 4: Pull request (Base fork: CSE574Spring2020's/Base: **Your-own-brunch** <— Head Fork: Your own/Compare: **Your-own-brunch**). Please make sure that you upload to **Your-own-brunch** as the base fork. 

We have create a unique branch for each group， which is prefixed with the name of your TA. If you do not find your group's branch, please ask your TA to create one. Please note that you will get **0 points** if we don't find codes on your own branch.

Milestone 1
Anil Kumar Kunchala: Data preparation, Creating
Dummy variables, Natural Language processing,
feature engineering, developed logistic regression
Wen Yu Chang: Exploratory data analysis,
independent model validation - logistic regression,
report writing.
Xuhui Chen: Exploratory data analysis, organized the
data and provided general statistic distribution of the
dataset.

Milestone 2
Anil Kumar Kunchala: Developed Random Forest
model, divided data based on animal type, evaluation
of performance of each model.
Wen Yu Chang: Developed K-Nearest Neighbors
model, model performance tuning, independent model
validation - decision tree, random forest, report writing,
evaluating model with and without description, project
demo.
Xuhui Chen: Developed Decision Tree model.

Milestone 3
Anil Kumar Kunchala: Implemented code for the input
data such that it matches train data (feature
transformation), applied Logistic regression, random
forest, separately for each part.
Wen Yu Chang: Developed Neural network model,
model tuning, UI widget design, report writing,
evaluating performance by splitting model based on
animal type, combine multiple notebooks into one
repository.
